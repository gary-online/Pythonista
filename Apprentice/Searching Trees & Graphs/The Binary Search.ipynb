    "# The Binary Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "A naive way to search for an element in a list is to check every element until you find the right one\n",
    "This would work for both sorted and unsorted lists and is complexity O(N)\n",
    "For a sorted list, however, we ought to do much better! \"Binary Search enters chat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "1. Choose an element at the mid-point of a sorted list\n",
    "2. Check whether it's smaller than or greater than the element you are looking for\n",
    "3. If the element at the mid-point is larger than the element you are searching for, halve the portion of the list you need to search by only considering elements before the midpoint\n",
    "4. Works ONLY with a sorted array; if the array is not sorted a linear search must be performed\n",
    "5. Working with a sorted list allows us to half the search area at every step\n",
    "6. Binary search works must faster than linear search\n",
    "7. The complexity of a binary search is O(log N)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Binary Search Tree\n",
    "1. A tree data structure is made up of nodes. Each node can point to a number of nodes, not just one\n",
    "2. Unlike stacks, queues, linked lists, etc., the order of the elements is not important in a tree\n",
    "3. It is a non-linear data structure\n",
    "4. A tree is typically used to represent a hierarchical information\n",
    "5. A general tree data structure can have any number of children but these trees are less useful and not very commonly used as a data structure\n",
    "6. In a binary tree, each node can have 0, 1, or 2 children\n",
    "7. It's best to focus on binary trees and its different variations\n",
    "8. The root node is an ancestor of every node\n",
    "9. Every node is a descendent of the root node\n",
    "10. A binary search tree is an \"ordered binary tree\" with specific characteristics; for every node in the tree there is a left and right subtree\n",
    "11. Left Subtree: that node has a value less than or equal to the value of the node\n",
    "12. Right Subtree: that node has a value greater than the value of the node\n",
    "13. The structure depends on the order in which nodes are inserted.\n",
    "14. The worst case time complexity of a lookup is O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion\n",
    "1. In a tree, when a new node is added, there is exactly one place that it can be.\n",
    "2. The structure of a tree depends on the order in which the nodes are added.\n",
    "3. The complexity for node insertion is O(logN)\n",
    "4. The actual complexity depends on the shape of the tree - skewed trees (i.e. with all left or right children only) can have complexity of O(N)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lookup\n",
    "1. While searching for a node in the tree, there is only one place where that node can be found.\n",
    "2. We can simply follow the right or left subtrees based on the value we want to find.\n",
    "3. The complexity for value look up is O(logN) in the average case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum Value Search in a Binary Search Tree\n",
    "1. The minimum value in a binary search tree can be found by traversing the left subtree of every node.\n",
    "2. For every node, its left child will have a value smaller than the node's value, and eventually, we will hit a node with no left child - the left-most value in the tree\n",
    "3. The left-most node contains the smallest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sum Paths in a Binary Search Tree\n",
    "1. Check if a path from the root to a leaf node sums up to a certain value.\n",
    "2. At every leaf node, check if the path to it sums to the value specified.\n",
    "3. Subtract the current node's value from the sum when recursing left and right towards the leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The binary tree - traversal\n",
    "1. What's interesting about binary trees is that there are several ways to visit the nodes of a tree\n",
    "2. They vary based on the order in which the nodes are accessed\n",
    "3. Visiting nodes of a tree is called traversing a tree\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Traversals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breadth-First\n",
    "1. Breadth first traversal involves visiting nodes at every level before moving on to the next level\n",
    "2. Start with the root node - it is at level 0 and is the first node to visit\n",
    "3. Next step is to check whether there are other nodes at the same level and visit them\n",
    "4. Once a level is exhausted, then we move to the next level\n",
    "5. We continue this until every node of the tree has been visited\n",
    "6. Start from the root and add it to a queue\n",
    "7. This uses some of the data structures we're already familiar with\n",
    "8. Dequeue and process the node\n",
    "9. Add its left then right child to the queue\n",
    "10. Continue this as long as the queue is not empty\n",
    "11. The nodes get added level-wise from left to right to the queue\n",
    "12. They are dequeued and processed in that order\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Depth-First\n",
    "1. Depth-first traversal involves going right to the leaf of the binary tree first before moving up the tree\n",
    "2. Going deep before moving up\n",
    "3. Here there are a whole variety of possibilities in how the nodes are processed\n",
    "4. All depth first traversals are most efficiently and intuitively implemented using recursion\n",
    "5. At every point we work with a subtree rooted at some node\n",
    "6. The recursive step is on 2 subtrees - the left and the right\n",
    "7. The base case is when the root is null\n",
    "8. Before pre-order\n",
    "9. In between or in-order\n",
    "10. After post-order\n",
    "11. "

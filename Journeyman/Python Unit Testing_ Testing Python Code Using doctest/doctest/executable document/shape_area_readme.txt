==================================
The shape_area_mod Module
==================================

This module includes functions to help you calculate the areas of different shapes. To use it in your code you will first need to import it into your source file:

	>>> import shape_area_mod

####### Triangles #########

The triangle function has two parameters - the base and height of the triangle whose area needs to be calculated. It returns the area of that triangle. It can be invoked in this manner, and the correct value will be returned in floating point format.

	>>> shape_area_mod.triangle(4, 9)
	18.0

####### Rectangles #########

The rectangle function has two parameters - the length and breadth of the rectangle whose area needs to be calculated. It returns the area of that rectangle and its invocation is done as specified below. This will return an integer or a floating point value depending on the arguments passed.

	>>> shape_area_mod.rectangle(3, 9)
	27

####### Square #########

The square function has a single parameter - the length of the square's edge. The value returned is the square area of the square which can be an integer or a floating point value. An example invocation is given below.

	>>> shape_area_mod.square(7)
	49
